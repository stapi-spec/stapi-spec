              into the current request body before following the link.
              This avoids passing large post bodies back and forth when following
              links, particularly for navigating pages through the `POST /search`
              endpoint.

              NOTE: To support form encoding it is expected that a client be able
              to merge in the key value pairs specified as JSON
              `{"next": "token"}` will become `&next=token`.
